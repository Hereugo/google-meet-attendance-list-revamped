# Google Meet Attendance List Revamped

This is a revamped version of Google Meet Attendance List. A Google Chrome extension that saves the list of people present in a Google Meet call at a particular time.

## Reasons for revamping

- The original extension stopped working, since Google has changed their UI. This extension of the extension would fix major bugs and possibly and new features.
- Codebase was not maintained well and not readable. 
- Possibly the extension didn't work when multiple google meets were open at the same time.
